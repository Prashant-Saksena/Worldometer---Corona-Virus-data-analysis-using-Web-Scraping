Worldometer - Corona Virus data analysis using Web Scraping

In this project, I extracted the CORONA Virus data through Web Scraping from the Worldometer website and performed the desired analysis.
Exploratory Analysis includes - Data Labelling, Cleaning and Visualizing the fetched data.

India claimed that we managed to deal in a better way with the COVID-19 virus as compared to other countries.
Based on the Analysis results, this claim was found to be true.
